# Yali

Yali stands for "Yet another Lox implementation", referring to the Lox language in ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters), by Bob Nystrom. There are several other origins of the word, but I take a page from the B programming language and leave any other connection ambiguous.

## Changes to the Interpreter

- Supports UTF-8 source code.
- Adds fancier error printing (like in the book).
